# Automobile Maintenance Tracker (OOP)

A console-based vehicle inventory and maintenance helper demonstrating core OOP concepts:
- Abstract base class `Vehicle` and derived classes `FuelVehicle`, `GasCar`, `DieselCar`, `ElectricCar`.
- Polymorphism, `virtual` methods, and `dynamic_cast`.
- Use of `std::vector<std::shared_ptr<...>>` to manage heterogeneous objects.
- Simple menu for add/list/update/remove vehicles and routine checks (tire rotation, oil, battery/charge).

## Features
- Encapsulation and accessors.
- Runtime type identification for vehicle-specific actions.
- Input validation and user-friendly prompts.
