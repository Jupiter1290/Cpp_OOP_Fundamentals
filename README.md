# Object-Oriented Programming in C++

This repository contains a collection of C++ mini-projects developed as part of the course **‚ÄúIntroduction to C++ Programming.‚Äù**  
These programs demonstrate a clear grasp of the **fundamental pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** ‚Äî encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and generic programming ‚Äî along with essential concepts such as file handling, dynamic memory management, and smart pointers.

## üìÇ Repository Structure and Topics

| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `Work-Station-Budget-Manager` | **Object-Oriented Workstation Budget Manager** ‚Äî A vendor quotation comparison tool that dynamically allocates memory for department-wise purchase data and writes a formatted summary report to a file. Demonstrates pointers, file I/O, and structured data handling. |
| `Object-Oriented-Automobile-Maintenance-Tracker` | **Automobile Maintenance Tracker** ‚Äî A polymorphic class hierarchy (`Vehicle`, `FuelVehicle`, `ElectricCar`) that manages an inventory of vehicles and performs routine maintenance checks (tire rotation, oil change, recharge). Uses inheritance, virtual functions, and `shared_ptr`. |
| `Billing_Operation` | **Template-Based Billing System** ‚Äî Implements a generic billing/invoicing class using C++ templates to handle multiple data types (int, float, double). Demonstrates generic programming, RAII, and formatted output using `<iomanip>`. |
| `OddEvenVehicleAllowance` | **Odd‚ÄìEven Vehicle Allowance Simulator** ‚Äî Simulates an odd‚Äìeven traffic rule system over multiple days, counting allowed 2-wheelers and 4-wheelers. Demonstrates abstraction (pure virtual base class), polymorphism, `unique_ptr`, and `static` members. |
| `LibraryReferenceTracker` | **Library Reference Tracker** ‚Äî Tracks how often books are referenced, identifies least-referenced books, and displays data in tabular form. Demonstrates encapsulation, dynamic object storage (`std::vector<std::unique_ptr>`), and formatted console output. |

## ‚öôÔ∏è Programming Concepts Covered
- **Encapsulation:** Data and methods wrapped within well-defined classes.  
- **Abstraction:** Abstract base classes and pure virtual functions.  
- **Inheritance & Polymorphism:** Reusable and extensible class hierarchies.  
- **Templates & Generic Programming:** Type-agnostic class and function definitions.  
- **Dynamic Memory Management:** Safe allocation and deallocation practices.  
- **Smart Pointers (`unique_ptr`, `shared_ptr`):** Modern C++ resource management.  
- **File Handling & I/O Formatting:** Writing structured reports and formatted console output.

## üß† Learning Outcomes
- Built a solid foundation in C++ syntax and OOP architecture.  
- Gained familiarity with memory-safe coding practices and STL containers.  
- Applied OOP principles to realistic scenarios such as billing, inventory management, and maintenance tracking.  
- Acquired confidence to design modular, reusable, and extensible C++ codebases.
