# Billing Operations (Template-based)

This program implements a generic billing/invoicing utility using a templated class `BillingOp<T>`.  
It accepts `n` commodities (name, unit price, quantity) and can operate with different numeric types (int, float, double) via templates.

## Features
- Demonstrates C++ templates and type-generic programming.
- Dynamic allocation and RAII (constructor / destructor).
- Basic arithmetic helper methods (`multiply`, `add`) and formatted invoice output.
